    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
        <br>
        of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>
        We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however <br>
        it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the <br>
        start dates for each one are as follows: <br>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semesteR: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://www.google.com">important university dates</a> on our
        website.</p>


    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — <br>
        as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. <br>
        You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person <br>
        we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,
        in order of priority:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
        <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
        <br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in
            <br>
            a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
        </dd>

        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
            <br>
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in <br>
            imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance
            <br>
            inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>

        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
            discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
            <br>
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
            because they were really cold.</dd>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
